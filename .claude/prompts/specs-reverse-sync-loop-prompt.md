# Constraints

- Read the impl-plan plans inside the folders project-specs/../impl-plan
- Read project-specs since it is the source of truth.
- Ensure do not break any of the completed tasks.

# Current State

- Verify the project and find out implemented requirements not defined in spec
- Take a single feature not defined in specs
- Add the feature to specs accordigly and update related implemention plan to mark them as implemented

# Future State

- We do not expect the specs or implementation plan be the same code than defined in code.
- Specs is the definition not the full implementation. Is is not expected the specs be a copy of the code.
- If all features in code are defined in spec exit with code 1.
